# Verilog
Verilog is a programming language which is very close to assembly language. It is used to implement functionalities in the areas of computer architecture and embedded systems.

## Some tips for you:
1. Try programming the 'not' gate.
2. Try deriving other basic logic gates using 'nor'gates.
3. The combinational and sequential circuits have been implemented using behavioural abstraction. 
4. For modules which are missing tb(test bench) files, the _tb files can be used as exercises for your practice.
